# CS230-GameProject
Location to store files collaboratively for FA2020 CS230 Game Project

A group of three people underwent a Software Engineering class.
This was our first exposure to git and our first exposure to larger scales of development.
It was also our first exposure to collaborative development.

The project itself is not finished. The intent was to have a dark, survival-horror, 2D-platformer puzzle game where the playable character is a pre-teen trapped in the basement of Microsoft Bob (based on the graphical interface for Windows 3.1) and the goal is to escape the horrible dream of said pre-teen and thus the clutches of MS Bob!

This is a dead project, it will remain in the state it is currently in.
